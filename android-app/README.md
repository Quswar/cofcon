Arduino-Bluetooth-Control
=========================

It is possible to control the board vie bluetooth using a HC-xx-modue for your Arduino. This small app ahs been tested and developen with a HC-06 and several Samsung Galaxy-Phones (I9000 and I9300). First Version has been designed using the [MIT AppInventor2][4], but it is still in development stage. Fot the future, maybe a better handling of BT-events and some more detailed interface including all the parameters and PID-tuning need to be done.

Features:
* Temperature display
* change set temperature
* Display of current PID parameters and heating power


TODO:
* good graphical interface for all PID parameters
* tuning-loop (Zieglerâ€“Nichols method)
* plotter for temperature and heating power
