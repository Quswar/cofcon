Some (hopefully) useful example logs are stored here. 

File format
===========
The "standard" cofcon-format of the plotter output is used, only the first line contains a header line with a title string for the machine, a string for the sensor used and a float for sensor accuracy/resolution.

A file normally starts like this:

Gaggia-CC TSIC 0.1
64951 23.20 99.50 50.00 0.00 0.00 1000.00
...

File list 
=========

* simulation-startup-tuning.log - Test run of internal simulation with heating phase and tuning loop
* gaggia-cc-startup-tuning.log - First run of my Gaggia CC with s TSIC-306 sensor to check for overshoot in the heating phase and first run of the tuning loop to tune PID parameters
